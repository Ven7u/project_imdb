As a lifetime Star Wars fan, I was sorely disappointed to see even the biggest fans laugh at the writing and concepts of this film during the midnight launch screening, if only the jokes were as funny. The film lets you know where it's going almost immediately, opening with a typical "poor signal radio" gag between two important parties, warning you that there is nothing to be taken seriously in this plot. These poor attempts at humour continue throughout the rest of the film, with excessive amounts of time spent on jovial scenes that only exist to pander to people who might not know the franchise or promote possible merchandise. This lack of finesse carries over into the writing and plot, most of the dialogue is downright cringe-worthy, not dissimilar to you might see in some kid's first fan film. The plot essentially doesn't exist, from beginning to end, nothing has changed in the larger universe. Furthermore, any significant plot points from the previous film that might have required an explanation are dismissed with an "Oh, yeah that was nothing". On top of the disaster that was the "plot", there are a multitude of lore-breaking cop outs and a very short timeline for the events of the film to occur in order to create suspense, which is then completely ignored. To sum up the script, it was lazy, unintelligent and full of continuity errors. All this film does is shit all over every aspect of Star Wars that fans love, characters included. It feels small, the characters are undeveloped and the sense of wonder that Star Wars is built on was entirely snuffed out. At least the prequels felt a part of something larger.
